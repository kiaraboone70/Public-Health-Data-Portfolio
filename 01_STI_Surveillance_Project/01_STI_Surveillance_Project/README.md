# STI Surveillance Analysis (2021â€“2023)

### Objective
Analyze sexually transmitted infection (STI) trends in Georgia and the U.S. (2021â€“2023), focusing on chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis across demographics and regions.

### Methods
- **Data Source:** CDC NCHHSTP AtlasPlus (Sexually Transmitted Diseases Dataset)
- **Tools Used:** R, SAS, Tableau  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Data cleaning and filtering by year, disease, and demographics  
  - Trend analysis and visualization  
  - Rate comparisons by year and population group  
  - Highlighting patterns in STI rate increases or decreases post-pandemic
    
### Variables Used
The dataset includes the following core variables extracted from CDC NCHHSTP AtlasPlus:

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Year** | Reporting year (2021â€“2023) |
| **State / Location** | U.S. state or territory where cases were reported |
| **Disease** | Type of STI (Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Primary & Secondary Syphilis) |
| **Sex** | Reported sex of cases (Male, Female, Unknown) |
| **Race/Ethnicity** | Reported racial or ethnic category |
| **Cases** | Number of reported STI cases |
| **Rate per 100,000** | Calculated rate of cases per 100,000 population |
| **Population** | Population denominator for rate calculation |

Additional variables may include age group or data notes, depending on the CDC export options selected.

### Notes
Data from 2020â€“2021 were impacted by COVID-19 testing and reporting disruptions. To ensure stability in year-to-year comparisons, this analysis focuses on data from **2021â€“2023**, which reflect more normalized surveillance and testing patterns.

### Key Findings (to be updated)
